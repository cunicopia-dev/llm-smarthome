For GE Aerospace, particular areas where risks or uncertainties could cause GE Aerospace’s actual results to be materially different than those expressed in GE Aerospace’s forward-looking statements include: changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including risk of recession, inflation, geopolitical conflict; supply chain constraints or disruptions, interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets (including GE Aerospace’s equity interest in GE HealthCare), commodity prices and exchange rates, and the impact of such changes and volatility on GE Aerospace’s business operations, financial results and financial position; GE Aerospace’s capital allocation plans, including the timing and amount of dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, organic investments, and other priorities; and other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such description may be updated or amended in any future reports that GE Aerospace files with the SEC.

This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow. Certain columns, rows or percentages within these reconciliations may not add or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers.

       "\" The documents provided seem to be related to financial statements and forward-looking statements of General Electric (GE) and its subsidiaries. The first document contains preliminary unaudited supplemental consolidated financial position information, cash flows information, earnings information, and segment information for the year ended December 31, 2023, and each of the interim periods within that year. The second document appears to be a table showing the estimated impact of the separation of GE Vernova on GE's financial statements.\\n\\nThe third document is a table showing the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP financial measures are used by management and investors as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. They provide additional information about GE's operating performance and help investors understand underlying trends in GE's business.\\n\\nThe fourth document contains forward-looking statements related to GE Aerospace's expected future business and financial performance and financial condition. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various factors, including changes in macroeconomic and market conditions, supply chain constraints or disruptions, and other risks.\\n\\nThe fifth document explains the reasons why GE uses non-GAAP financial measures and provides a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures allows for greater comparability of GE's operating performance between periods by excluding certain items that are not considered part of GE's core operations or that may not be indicative of GE's ongoing performance. These items include restructuring and other charges, gains or losses on dispositions, and other significant items.\""
